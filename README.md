# Wordle Pt. 1 Starter

This is the starter project for iOS 101 Project 1 - Wordle Pt. 1

Submitted by: **Angie Martinez**

**Wordle Pt. 1** is an app that allows the user to enter the word of the day. The user has 6 tries until 
they run out of spaces to fill in. However, if the user manages to get the word correct before all 6 spots
fill up, they completed the task in x amount of tries.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Notes

Some challenges I encountered with this project was dealing with the syntax of Swift and learning how to develop software in Xcode for the first time. The hints throughout the project were very helpful, however, it remained challenging for some time.
